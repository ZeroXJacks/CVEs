# ZeroXJacks - CVE-2026-25762
## Overview
**CVE-2026-25762** is a high-severity Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability discovered in the `@adonisjs/bodyparser` package. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to crash an AdonisJS server by exhausting its available RAM (Memory Exhaustion).

## Technical Analysis
The vulnerability exists in the way `bodyparser` handles `multipart/form-data` requests. When a file is uploaded, the parser attempts to determine the file type by inspecting its "Magic Numbers".

### The Flaw
The internal buffer used to store these initial bytes was **unbounded**. If an attacker sends a continuous stream of data that does not match any known file signature, the server continues to buffer the incoming data in memory indefinitely.

### Impact
A single malicious request can consume all available system memory, triggering an **Out-of-Memory (OOM)** event, leading to process termination and complete Denial of Service.

```bash
# Example logic: Sending garbage data to a file upload endpoint
curl -X POST [http://target.com/upload](http://target.com/upload) \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=something" \
  --data-binary @large_random_binary_file
```
