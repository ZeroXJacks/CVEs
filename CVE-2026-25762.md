### Overview
CVE-2026-25762 is a high-severity Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability discovered in the @adonisjs/bodyparser package. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to crash an AdonisJS server by exhausting its available RAM (Memory Exhaustion).

### Technical Analysis
The vulnerability exists in the way bodyparser handles multipart/form-data requests. When a file is uploaded, the parser attempts to determine the file type by inspecting its "Magic Numbers" (the first few bytes of the stream).

### The Flaw
The internal buffer used to store these initial bytes was unbounded. If an attacker sends a continuous stream of data that does not match any known file signature, the server continues to buffer the incoming data in memory indefinitely, hoping to find a match.

### Impact
Since there was no limit on the size of this "sniffing" buffer, a single malicious request can consume all available system memory, triggering an Out-of-Memory (OOM) event. This leads to the Node.js process being terminated, resulting in a complete Denial of Service for all users.
